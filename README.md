Welcome to StartUP!
===================
#### By _**Haneen Abu-Khater**_

Welcome to the new StartUp App where you can add local events and keep track of the attendees! **StackUpProject**[^project]. Don't delete me, I'm very helpful! I can be recovered anyway in the **Utils** tab of the <i class="icon-cog"></i> **Settings** dialog.

Description
-------------

StartUp stores your events in your browser, which means all your events are automatically saved locally and are accessible **offline!**

> **Note:**

> - StartUp App is accessible offline after the application has been loaded for the first time.
> - Your local documents are not shared between different browsers or computers.
> - Clearing your browser's data may **delete all your local documents!** Make sure your documents are synchronized with **Google Drive** or **Dropbox** (check out the [<i class="icon-refresh"></i> Synchronization](#synchronization) section).

#### <i class="icon-file"></i> Create an Event

To create an event select <i class="icon-folder-open"></i> **Add a New Event** Tab in the navigation bar on the top left part of the site. You can create a new event by clicking <i class="icon-file"></i> **Add Event** in the event form.
